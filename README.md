# Senior/Lead Frontend Engineer (React, Typescript) assignment - List of manufactures

Thank you for taking the time to apply.
If you have any questions, you can contact us on Telegram https://t.me/fromjimmy

You may submit your work in .zip format or you can deploy it to your Github/Bitbucket.

## Assignment:

A web application with a list of vehicle manufacturers which I can click on to see them in detail.

The whole application is utilizing publicly accessible data https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/.

The list of manufacturers is a paginated table with these columns: ID, common name and country. Besides that, there's an additional column with a button which leads to the detail page. Users can simply see more pages by clicking a “Load More” button.

The detail page shows me exactly the same data as in the list + there's a list of all the model names of all the makes of that one manufacturer.

From the architectural perspective, the application must be loosely coupled. Keep in mind the best practices for building web applications including automated testing and performance.

## Technical Requirements:

-   TypeScript
-   React v16+
-   Tests included
-   Loose coupling

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
